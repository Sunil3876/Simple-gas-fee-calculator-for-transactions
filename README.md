## Project Title

**Simple Gas Fee Calculator for Transactions**

## Project Description

The **Simple Gas Fee Calculator** is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to estimate the gas fees for Ethereum transactions. This contract helps users calculate the gas fee for a transaction based on the gas limit and gas price. It also offers a simple interface to fetch the current gas price from the Ethereum network and estimate a basic gas limit for transactions.

## Project Vision

The vision behind this project is to provide a simple and efficient solution for calculating gas fees for Ethereum transactions. It aims to help users better understand and plan their transactions in terms of gas costs. The project targets developers, users, and anyone interacting with Ethereum-based applications who wish to estimate and manage gas fees before executing their transactions.

## Future Scope

- **Gas Fee Optimization:** Future versions of this contract could integrate gas optimization techniques to suggest better gas limits for different types of transactions (e.g., smart contract interactions).
- **Support for Layer 2 Networks:** Expanding the contract to work with Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups or zk-Rollups, to calculate gas fees on alternative networks.
- **Real-time Gas Fee Predictions:** Integrating with external APIs for real-time gas fee predictions based on network congestion and traffic patterns.
- **User Interface (UI):** Developing a web-based front-end for users to interact with the contract and get gas fee estimates without needing to manually input values.

## Key Features

- **Gas Fee Calculation:** Allows users to calculate gas fees based on the gas limit and gas price.
- **Current Gas Price Retrieval:** Provides the ability to get the current gas price directly from the Ethereum network.
- **Gas Limit Estimation:** Estimates a rough gas limit for basic transactions, particularly useful for simple transfers.
- **Easy Integration:** The contract is designed for easy integration into decentralized applications (dApps) or any Ethereum-based interface.

## Installation

To deploy this contract:

1. Use Remix IDE or a local Ethereum testnet like Ganache to deploy the contract.
2. Interact with the contract using a web3 library like `web3.js` or `ethers.js` from a front-end dApp.
3. Optionally, integrate the contract into a dApp for a user-friendly interface for calculating gas fees.
